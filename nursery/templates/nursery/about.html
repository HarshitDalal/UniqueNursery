                    We have big dreams - for everyone.

                    Fully sustainable food farms on every inch of empty unused urban real estate, pan India dispatch
                    centres and nurseries that deliver plants to every home in every pin code, and a family of customers
                    who are more family than customer. We aim to make growing our own food a norm to reduce the carbon
                    footprint we generate and in the process neutralize environmental carbon percentage further.
